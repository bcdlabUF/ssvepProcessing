# ssvepProcessing

These scripts can be used to process data from an ssvep task. 

Step1_BEES_data_pipeline.m uses BEES_Split_Cond_batch.m and BEES_clean_data_batch.m and combines the time domain pre-processing into a streamlined step-by-step file. Run this file in chunks (Run Section) to first split and clean your files and then detect artifacts and remove bad trials.

All of the included files are completely customizable.
