# ssvepProcessing

These scripts can be used to process data from an ssvep task. 

BEES_data_pipeline.m uses BEES_Split_Cond_batch.m and BEES_clean_data_batch.m and combines the time domain pre-processing into a streamlined step-by-step file. 

All of the included files are completely customizable.
